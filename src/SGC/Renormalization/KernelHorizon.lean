# The Kernel Horizon Theorem

The measure-reentry program's first genuine *dynamic* statement: for a
discrete Markov kernel, the finite-time closure error grows **at most
linearly in the number of steps, with rate constant exactly the norm of
the closure commutator** — hence the validity horizon of the canonical
macro-law is inverse in the defect.

Physical time is unambiguous here (the colleague's calibration point): `T`
is a one-step transition kernel, `T^n` is the state after `n` steps.

## Main results

* `IsStochastic` — row-stochastic kernels (entrywise nonnegative, unit row
  sums).
* `coarseKernel_isStochastic` — the canonical coarse kernel
  `T̂^π = CoarseGenerator T P π` of a stochastic kernel is stochastic:
  the conditional exit average of a probability kernel is a probability
  kernel.
* `linfty_opNorm_le_one_of_stochastic`, `stochastic_pow_norm_le_one`,
  `lift_matrix_linfty_le_one` — all propagators are non-expansive in the
  `L∞ → L∞` operator norm (max row L¹ norm).
* **`kernel_closure_error_le`** — THE KERNEL HORIZON THEOREM:
  `‖T^n·K − K·(T̂^π)^n‖ ≤ n · ‖𝒞_T‖`.
  Finite-time closure error is at most (number of steps) × (one re-entry
  event's size). Immediate from the discrete Duhamel identity
  (`power_closure_telescoping`) plus non-expansiveness.
* `within_tolerance_of_defect_small` — the horizon reading: every step
  count `n` with `n·‖𝒞_T‖ ≤ η` is inside the tolerance-`η` validity
  horizon. Inverse-defect scaling of the horizon, as a theorem.

## Honest scope

* The `L∞` operator norm of `𝒞_T` is `max_i Σ_B |residual(i,B)|` — the
  worst-state total re-entry rate (`𝔇_∞`-flavoured). The relation to the
  `π`-weighted `𝔇_π` (Cauchy-Schwarz, cardinality factors) is a planned
  elementary lemma, not stated here.
* Linear-in-`n` is an upper bound; no claim that it is tight (mixing can
  make the true error saturate — that refinement is the open
  `T_η ~ 1/𝔇` scaling question, `docs/measure-reentry.md` §3).
* Continuous-time bridge (`T = e^{ΔtL}`, error `≤ Δt·𝔇_π + O(Δt²)`) is
  deliberately NOT attempted here (colleague's sequencing: after the
  discrete theorem).

/-- **THE KERNEL HORIZON THEOREM.** For a stochastic kernel `T` and any
partition `P` with positive reference measure, the `n`-step closure error
of the canonical macro-kernel is at most `n` times the size of a single
re-entry event:

`‖T^n·K − K·(T̂^π)^n‖ ≤ n · ‖𝒞_T‖`.

Proof: the discrete Duhamel identity expands the error into `n` single
re-entry events; every fine and coarse propagator is non-expansive; the
triangle inequality does the rest. -/
